# Elastic exporter Demo

This demo is a sample app to build the collector and export traces to the Elastic Stack.

Copy/paste in your `apm_server_url` and `secret_token`, then switch to this directory and run

```
docker-compose up
```

Hit `http://localhost:8081` in your browser a few times and open the APM app to see the results.
