# OpenTelemetry Collector Demo

This demo is a sample app to build the collector and exercise its tracing functionality.

To build and run the demo, switch to this directory and run

`docker-compose up`

Then go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` and click some buttons. Traces will be sent to the Elastic Stack.
